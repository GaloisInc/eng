* eng: the Engineering tool

** What is it?

 The eng tool is designed to perform project and product engineering tasks.
 Engineering tasks include:

   * design
   * development
   * documentation
   * release management
   * bug tracking
   * feature tracking
   * task management
   * requirements definitions
   * configuration management

 Most software developers and projects are familiar with the development process
 from an applied manner: projects have some sort of build description that lets a
 build tool create a runnable version of the project.

 Some projects have documentation to varying degrees: README's are common, guides
 for installation, usage, and quickstart are the next most common.  Other
 documentation tends to be rare: requirements documents, design documents, API
 specifications, etc.

 Many projects are maintained in a tool that provides varying amounts of
 additional capabilities such as release management and bug tracking, but those
 tend to exist in the tooling itself and separate from the project data.  For
 example, Github provides issues (bug tracking), pull requests (development), and
 tags/artifacts (release management), but these are all part of Github itself and
 not available to anyone working with an offline clone of the repo.

 The ~eng~ tool is intended to consolidate all these different aspects of
 engineering into the main portion of a project and provide a way to interact
 with them.

** Discoverability

 One of the keys to being able to use ~eng~ (or any tool) is discoverability.
 The ability to use a tool effectively means that the tool should be a supporting
 partner in its usage, for both beginning and experienced users.  To this end,
 ~eng~ has been designed so that you can specify as little or as much as possible
 and ~eng~ can indicate what or how that command can be used.

 When in doubt, just type ~eng~, and don't be afraid type type ~eng help~ or
 ~eng CMD~ to receive guidance.

** What's it for?

 The eng tool is used when you want to think like an "eng"ineer.

 Imagine a situation where you encounter a brand new project.  One of your first
 questions is "where is the documentation". While there is somewhat of a
 convention of looking for a README that provides some assistance, you could
 instead just enter ~$ eng doc~, which would tell you that there is a ~list~
 sub-command, so then you could type ~$ eng doc list~ to see all the different
 documentation available for the project.

 The next thing you are likely to want to do is build the project.  Instead of
 trying to figure out what build tool is used, and how to invoke it, just
 type ~$ eng dev~.  The project can define a "build" subcommand (via
 the ~_eng_~ subdirectory) that will handle invoking the build tool.  Maybe
 there are a couple of different targets that could be built; ~$ eng dev~ will
 show you those targets, and you can invoke each one.

 What about testing the application?  In the output of ~$ eng dev~ you can
 observe it reported subcommands for ~test~ and ~testlist~.  The ~$ eng dev
 testlist~ will display a list of the testsna and ~$ eng dev test~ will run them
 (the project-supplied ~_eng_~ configuration provides the actual commands that
 ~eng~ will run to perform the tests).

 When you think like an engineer, you want to "build" or "doc" or "test".  The
 ~eng~ tool provides the *discoverable* high-level coordination commands to do
 these things.

 Note that ~eng~ will always echo the actual commands it is going to run to
 stdout.  Nothing is hidden.  This allows you to cut and paste the commands to
 modify them (adding or removing flags) or run them directly or in another
 environment.  Using ~eng~ should not lock you in, using ~eng~ should feel like
 you have a trusty assistant helping you get things done.

** Why not use ____?

 Why not use make or a task management tool or a shell script or ____?

*** Simplicity

 The ~eng~ tool is designed to be simple to use, and simple in what it does.  It
 does not have lots of advanced features like internal scripting, dependency
 rebuild checking, etc.  There are other tools that are better at those things
 (e.g. make/cmake/ninja/meson/bazel/etc.  for dependency rebuild checking).
 Instead, ~eng~ simply collects those commands and their project-specific
 arguments into easy top-level operations.

 This also means that ~eng~ has a large feature inertia.  When considering
 whether to add a new feature to ~eng~

*** Visibility

 As mentioned above, ~eng~ always shows you what it does, so that you can run
 variations of those operations directly.  It's your assistant with a good memory
 of how to accomplish the main top-level tasks in the standard way.

*** Discoverability

 While there is a way to embed help information in GNUmake, that is specific to
 GNUmake. Do you know how to embed that in your Makefile?  Do you know how to get
 it when running make?

 Do you know how to get help when running Meson?  When running bazel?  When
 running ninja?  Or gradle? Or sbv? Or cargo? Or cabal? Or npm? Or gprbuild?
 There are lots of build tools, some are general and some are specific to
 language ecosystems, and sometimes a project even uses multiple of these.

 So how do you figure out what you want to do?  With ~eng~, you can start by just
 typing ~eng~.  Then add more to the ~eng~ command line based on the help ~eng~
 provides until you end up being able to do what you wanted to do without trying
 to read build configuration files.

*** Single purpose

 As noted above, some projects use multiple build tools. Or try to adapt their
 build tool to do other things which don't really match the build tool's
 capabilities.  And sometimes they supply scripts or other tools when they need
 additional functionality that the build tool cannot do.

 The ~eng~ tool's single purpose is to coordinate all the top-level activities.
 If some of those are achieved via a build tool and some are via a script, that's
 all specified in the ~_eng_~ configuration and ~eng~ provides a standard
 top-level interface to those operations.

*** Independence

 The ~eng~ tool is not intended to *replace* any of the regular tools used by the
 project.  It's designed to coordinate their use from a top-level.  Thus, it does
 not conflict with other tools, and it does not try to do things it is not well
 suited for.

*** Standardized interaction

 Using ~eng~ changes very little across projects.  Each project can have
 project-specific subcommands, but these are discoverable and self-documenting.
 If every project provided an ~eng~ configuration, then new users to a project
 (as well as long-time developers) can start with running ~$ eng~ and have good
 chance of being successful without devoting significant time to learning new
 tools and new configurations and processes.

 And hey, why limit ~eng~ usage to humans?  Now that ~eng~ knows how to
 coordinate the high-level project tasks like building and testing, just setup
 your CI to use ~eng~.
 
*** Project-controlled Configurability

 What ~eng~ is capable of doing is almost entirely specified by what the project
 places into the configuration files in the ~_eng_~ directory.  This means that
 it's the responsibility of the project team to provide useful functionality via
 ~eng~, but the ~_eng_~ configuration is version controlled and can be
 updated/enhanced by both project developers and users because it uses a very
 simple text-based syntax and supports tracking changes to that configuration.
 
** Installing

 The only dependency for the ~eng~ tool is SWI Prolog.  The SWI Prolog tool can
 be installed in most systems via the local package manager.  The ~eng~ tool is
 OS independent and can be used under Linux, MacOS, or Windows.

 To build and configure ~eng~:

 1. Download the ~eng~ repository and change to that directory
 2. ~./eng.sh dev bootstrap~

    _Note_: use ~eng.bat~ instead of ~eng.sh~ under Windows.

 The secopnd step above creates an ~eng~ file, which is the executable file for
 the tool.  You can copy this file to a location in your current ~PATH~
 (e.g. ~/usr/local/bin~, ~$HOME/bin~, etc.), or you can add the current directory
 to your ~PATH~.

*** Getting started

  Once ~eng~ has been installed, the following commands will demonstrate the
  usage of ~eng~ and lead to further information:

  #+begin_example
  $ eng
  $ eng doc
  $ eng doc list
  $ eng doc info eng_tool
  $ eng doc show eng_tool
  $ eng help
  $ eng help doc
  $ eng system list
  $ eng system gen Lando
  #+end_example

** How does it work?

 Information for the ~eng~ tool is provided by adding ~.eng~ files to the project
 (normally in an ~_eng_~ directory at the project's top-level); each ~.eng~ file
 provides information related to one or more of the above areas, with data
 appropriate to that type of information.  Although a single ~.eng~ file can
 contain multiple types of data, it's more typical to use a different ~.eng~ file
 for each component of information.  The ~.eng~ files are intended to be managed
 via the version control for the project just like the other sources.

 The ~eng~ tool is run, specifying a sub-command.  The tool will read the various
 ~eng~ files provided for the project to perform the requested sub-command.  Each
 sub-command can use various portions of the information to perform an action
 associated with that sub-command.  Some of the commands may create or update
 ~.eng~ files; this updates the project state managed by ~eng~ and these changes
 should be committed to the version control system to maintain accurate project
 state.

** Syntax for ~.eng~ files

 The syntax for the ~.eng~ files is associated with the type of information being
 provided; the "type" of information refers to a category of engineering tasks or
 concerns like to those described in the introduction section above.  There may
 be (and usually are) multiple "components" of information in each category
 (e.g. multiple "bugs" in the bug tracking category).  Each component is
 introduced by an "introductory phrase" that uniquely identifies the type of
 information; the introductory phrase is followed by additional phrases that
 together provide all the data for that component.  If multiple components are
 presented in the same ~.eng~ file, each is started by a corresponding
 "introductory phrase" that terminates the information for any preceding
 component and begins the new component; multiple components in the same file do
 not necessarily need to have the same type.

 Specific syntax is provided in detailed sections of the eqil_design
 documentation.

** ~eng~ commands

 The user invokes the ~eng~ tool with a sub-command to be performed in that
 particular run.  The sub-commands are pre-defined, although many provide a way
 for the user (project developers) to extend or configure the command with
 regards to the specific actions it performs.

 Many of the commands will update the ~.eng~ files; these updates should be
 preserved as they maintain the evolving engineering state of the project.  Note
 that this means that "rolling back" to a previous commit for the project will
 also roll-back this state.  Automated updates to the ~eng~ files are intended to
 be compatible with merge processes, but some sub-commands may perform parallel
 actions that will result in ~.eng~ conflicts when merged together; these
 situations represent Engineering practices that require manual resolution
 anyhow, so this is viewed as somewhat of a feature: resolving these conflicts in
 the ~.eng~ files helps resolve the associated Engineering issue.  This latter
 statement is understandably vague; more information will be provided to clarify
 these in the description of the commands where these are likely to occur.

 Tne various ~eng~ commands provided are described by simply issuing the ~eng~
 command with no arguments.  The ~eng help COMMAND~ can be used to get more
 information about a specific command.

** Ease of use

 The ~eng~ command is designed to be easily used to perform engineering
 management for a project.  To facilitate this, it is utilized as a single file
 written in an interpreted language for which an interpreter is widely avaiable
 for multiple platforms.  It is possible to copy the entire ~eng~ tool into the
 project itself as a single file, or else use an ~eng~ implementation referenced
 from the current ~PATH~ or other executable specification method.

 All ~eng~ commands will provide help describing their action if passed the
 ~--help~ argument.  Most commands provide a ~--dry-run~ argument that would
 describe what would be done without actually performing those actions, and the
 effects of any command which has impacts purely local to the working directory
 tree can be reversed by using the version control tool to discard or revert the
 changes; the same is not necessarily true for commands that have impact outside
 of the current working directory tree, although many of those commands provide a
 ~--revert~ argument; see their individual ~--help~ for more information.

** Ouroboros

 The ~eng~ tool is managed by: the ~eng~ tool.  It is perhaps a more complex use
 of the tool than is useful for *learning* the tool, but it should be a good
 representative example of what can actually be done with the tool.
